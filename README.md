# asmpong
A very simple pong game written in assembly using SDL2.

All linking to SDL is done manually. Yes, that is as fun as it sounds. You should try it out!  
It's not as hard as it sounds and there are plenty of good resources around. It was a very good learning experience.

I'm not sure how portable this is. I wrote this last year and while it has been tested on two computers I can't remember if I did any nonportable optimizations after that or not.

Compile with **nasm**

Needs this to run.
